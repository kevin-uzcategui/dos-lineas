= Do you want to install a demo? =

1. You have to follow the previous steps of installing and activating the theme
2. Go to Appearance> Install Plugins (If you already have the necessary compounds this connection will not be, so you can go to step 5)
3. Install the Plugins that are listed.
4. Activate the Plugins. You can do it from the panel itself or by going to Plugins > Installed Plugins. 
5. Once the Plugins are installed you will get a new option found in Appearance> Import Demo Data (If the sale does not reload the page).

Additional note: If you are going to use WooCommerce, install it before exporting the demo. This is for you to export the WooCommerce demo data, if the demo you chose has them. It doesn't matter if you don't do it this way, but at the end of the export it will send you a warning message that you won't worry about.
